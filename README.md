## Hi Friends! I'm Megan 👋

I'm a Backend Developer and Instructor.  I love to learn new things about programming, and share my learnings with my students.  Few things are as satisfying to me as unraveling a tricky bug 🐛.  When not at my computer, you can find me curled up in my knitting nook, walking my two dogs, or chasing some adrenaline in the mountains.

## 🏗️I'm currently working on...
Building some new curriculum for the [TuringSchool Launch Program](https://github.com/turingschool/launch-curriculum).  Ask me about what it's like to switch from Ruby to C#!
